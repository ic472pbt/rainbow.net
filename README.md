# Rainbow.Net
## Project Overview
Rainbow.Net is a revolutionary artificial neural network (NNW) project developed in F# that aims to address fundamental challenges in the field of machine learning. This project is named Rainbow because it operates on data as a signal, with each spectral component handled individually, much like the colors of a rainbow. The name reflects our approach of treating different components of data separately, allowing for more nuanced and targeted analysis.

## Key Features
- Signal-based Processing: Rainbow.Net treats data as signals, allowing for individual handling of spectral components.
- Modular Design: The project is designed with modularity in mind, enabling easy integration of new features and enhancements.
- Dynamic Learning: Rainbow.Net learns dynamically as it is built, offering a more stable learning process compared to traditional NNW models.
- Human Interpretability: Efforts are made to ensure that the weights generated by Rainbow.Net are readable and interpretable by humans, addressing a common issue in NNW models.
## About the Name
The name Rainbow was chosen to reflect the project's unique approach to handling data as a signal, with each component treated individually. Through our research and development efforts, I discovered that individual waves in the output signal can be generated independently, further emphasizing the spectral nature of data processing in Rainbow.Net.
